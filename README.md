This repository showcases the way I learned and practiced the C programming language.

I completed two university courses to learn C programming:

1. Introduction to Programming Language (ICS – 1 credit hour)

2. Structured Programming Language (SPL – 4 credit hours)

Although I learned most of the concepts from various online resources such as GeeksforGeeks, Programiz.com, and W3Schools, the faculty members of these courses guided me significantly and helped me strengthen my understanding.
